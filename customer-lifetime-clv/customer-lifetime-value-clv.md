# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

## Profit Calculation

* Revenues
* Cost of Goods Gold

**= Gross Margin**

* Fixed Expenses

**= Profit**

## FIve Strategic Options of CLV

According to Professor Noel Capon:

Three applications of CLV:

* **Customer Selection:** Improve Targeting and Acquisition
* **Customer Loyalty:** Improve Future Purchaes
* **Customization**: Improve Targeting of Offers

with two major results:

* **Increased Prices: **Better Selection, Loyalty, Customization may produce Price Inelasticity
* **Reduced Operating Costs**: Economies of Scale

additional benefits:

* **Learning**: Firm learns how to better attract and meet needs of targeet customer populations
* **Network Effects**: More customers mean finding more customers
* **Referrals and WOM**: Customer credibility results in finding more customers
* **Signals**: High-profile customers may provide firm with additional credibiity

## CLV Simple Model

The net present value of the profits linked to a specific customer once the customer has been acquired, after subtracting incremental costs associated with marketing, selling, production and servicing over the customer’s lifetime.

**Initial Profit + Profit from Future Periods = Total CLV**

Profit from Future Periods may consist of:

* **Recurring Income Stream **(Contractual; maintenance, monthly subscriptions, etc)
  * _Estimated $ Margin \\_ Avg # of Payments\*
* **Additional Income Stream** (Non-Contractual; new products and services)
  * _Estimated $ Margin \\_ Estimated p(success)\*

## CLV Factors

In order to measure CLV we need:

* **CASH FLOW:** the net present value of the income generated by the customer throughout their relationship with the organization
* **LIFECYCLE:** the duration of the relationship with the organization
* **MAINTENANCE COST: **associated costs to ensure that the flow of revenue per customer is achieved
* **RISK COST: **risk associated with a client
* **ACQUISITION COST:** costs and effort required to acquire a new customer.
* **RETENTION COST: **costs and effort required to retain a new customer.
* **DISCOUNT RATE: ** expresses the amount of interest paid/earned as a percentage of the balance at the end of the (annual) period.

Additionally,

* **RECOMMENDATION VALUE: **impact of the recommendations of a customer in its sphere of influence on company revenue
* **SEGMENTATION: **additional customer segmention information that can be applied before or after measuring the CLV

## Models

Depending on whether our customers are in a Contractual setting or not (i.e. a customer lifetime is ‘known’ based on a contractual agreement vs. customers simply attrite), we may apply different methods.

**Contractual:**

* Naive
* RFM Summaries
* Markov Chains
* Hazard Rate Models
* Survival Regression
* Supervised ML (Random Forest)

**Non-Contractual:**

* Heuristics (Rule-based)
* Distribution-based approaches
  * Pareto/NBD
  * Beta-Geometric/NPD
  * Markov Chain Models
  * etc

## CLV General Formula

Where** E **is Expected Value, **V-hat** is the customer’s net profit to the firm, **delta** is the discount rate, and time periods are **t**.

\begin{align} CLV = \Sigma \frac{E\[\hat{V\_t}]} {(1+\delta)^{t-1}} \end{align}

In order to calculate CLV, we need to understand **costs** and we need to estimate the future behavior of customers. There are many methods for approaching these two questions.

## Estimating Past CLV using ARPU/ARPA

ARPU (Average Revenue per User or Account) can be used to calculate historical CLV.

* Calculate the average revenue per customer per month.
* Sum for all months, and then multiply by 12 or 24 to get a one- or two-year CLV.
