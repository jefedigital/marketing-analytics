Adstock is a model of how response to advertising builds and decays in consumer markets.

There are two dimensions to advertising adstock; the Decay Effect and the Diminishing Returns Effect.

### Decay Effect: Advertising Lag&#x20;

This decay effect can be mathematically modeled and is usually expressed in terms of the ‘half-life’ of the advertising.\
\
Some academic studies have suggested half-life range around 7– 12 weeks,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising\_adstock#cite\_note-2) while industry practitioners typically report half- lives between 2–5 weeks, with the average for [Fast Moving Consumer Goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-moving\_consumer\_goods) (FMCG) Brands at 2.5 weeks.\
\
Adstock half-life can be estimated through a distributed lag model response with lags of the TV [Gross Ratings Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross\_rating\_point) (GRP) variable, using [Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least\_squares).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising\_adstock#cite\_note-3)\
\
**Simple Decay-Effect Model:**\

Where _At_ is the Adstock at time _t_, _Tt_ is the value of the advertising variable at time _t_, and λ (lambda) is the ‘decay’ or lag weight parameter. Inclusion of the _At-1_ term imparts an infinite lag structure to this model, with the effect of the first Adstock term approaching 0, as _t_ tends to ∞.\
\
This is a simple decay model, because it captures only the dynamic effect of advertising, not the diminishing returns effect.

### Diminishing Returns Effect: Advertising Saturation

Typically each incremental amount of advertising causes a progressively lesser effect on demand increase. This is advertising saturation.\

\
Adstock can be transformed to an appropriate nonlinear form like the [logistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic\_distribution) or [negative exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative\_exponential\_distribution), depending upon the type of diminishing returns or ‘saturation’ effect the response function is believed to follow.

### Campaign Carry-Over

The carryover theory states that the positive benefits from advertising, especially increased sales, are not perfectly in step with advertising movements but rather delayed and spread out over time so that changes may not be noticeable immediately or measurable right after the advertising strategy has gone into effect.\
